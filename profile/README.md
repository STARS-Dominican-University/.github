# Hi, We're STARS: Science and Technology Applications for Research in Space at Dominican University

Our focus remains on automating the monitoring of lunar conditions in order to maintain an ongoing process of harvesting sensor data. We solely focus on lunar topography. NASA's pioneering projects necessitate cost-effective solutions, given recent budget reductions. Our official proposal, “Integration of LIDAR Technology for Self- Sufficient Lunar Sensors,” aims to contribute both scientifically and frugally to these initiatives. Our device would relay valuable topographic information to scientists. With a large-scale adoption of our device, a detailed, continually updated, topographic map of the lunar surface could be transmitted for analysis.


## Who We Are

We are a dedicated research team at Dominican University, focused on developing innovative technology. Our goal is to achieve success in our endeavors and create a foundation for future students to carry on this organization at DU.
