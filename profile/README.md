# Hi, We're STARS: Science and Technology Applications for Research in Space at Dominican University

Our concept focuses on automating the monitoring of lunar conditions to enhance astronaut safety and pinpoint optimal base locations. We aim to maintain a continuous process of data analysis concerning the lunar surface’s topography, radiation levels, and atmospheric conditions, and potentially extend this approach to other celestial surfaces. In addition, NASA’s groundbreaking projects often incur substantial financial costs, and recent budget cuts have underscored the need for innovative and cost-effective solutions. Given the impending Artemis missions, our proposal aligns with the aim of assisting both scientifically and financially in these endeavors. 


## Who We Are

We are a dedicated research team at Dominican University, focused on developing innovative technology. Our goal is to achieve success in our endeavors and create a foundation for future students to carry on this organization at DU.
